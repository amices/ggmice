# ggmice 0.0.1

## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* Changed 'http' to 'https' in an invalid URL in the README file (as requested, thanks!).
* Renamed the file CRAN_COMMENTS.md to cran-comments.md for compatibility with devtools::release().
* Changed the word 'workflows' to 'workflow' in the DESCRIPTION to avoid a NOTE about spelling.
